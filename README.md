# A survey of RSE training resources

Did you know that there is a career track with the job title _[Research Software Engineer](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7994286)_? Well, if you are not already one, you could **become one**!

This repository (and eventually webpage) aims to collect _very good_ resources on teaching and learning RSE skills. Examples include:

- Which university programs could I attend to study and become a professional RSE?
- Which coherent online courses could I follow to build up skills from the set defined in the (TODO: link) RSE Competencies?
- What material can I reuse for teaching my students about RSE skills defined in the (TODO: link) RSE Competencies?

We aim for original and extensive resources, targetting both general-purpose RSEs, as well as RSE specializations.

## How to contribute?

For now, and until we have a concrete framework, [open an issue](https://github.com/DE-RSE/survey_rse_training/issues). We are collecting similar resources in [this issue](https://github.com/DE-RSE/survey_rse_training/issues/2).
